    "Training phase: The algorithm stores the entire training dataset in memory, including the feature vectors and their corresponding class labels or output values.\n",

The selection of K depends on various factors and should be determined carefully based on the characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand. Here are some common approaches to choosing the value of K:\n",

    "Rule of thumb: A common rule of thumb is to take the square root of the total number of data points in the training set as the value of K. For example, if you have 100 data points, you might start with K=10. This approach provides a reasonable starting point, but it may not be optimal for all datasets.\n",

    "Odd values for binary classification: If you have a binary classification problem (two classes), it is often recommended to choose an odd value for K to avoid ties when voting for the majority class. This way, you can have a definitive majority. For example, you can choose K=3, 5, 7, and so on.\n",

    "Cross-validation: Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, can help evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm for different values of K. By splitting the training data into multiple folds and iteratively training and testing the algorithm, you can assess its performance and select the K value that yields the best results. This approach helps in avoiding overfitting or underfitting by finding an optimal K value that generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain knowledge and experimentation: Consider any prior knowledge or domain-specific insights that might guide your choice of K. For example, if you know that the classes in your dataset are well-separated, a smaller value of K might work well. On the other hand, if the classes overlap or have a lot of noise, a larger K value may be more appropriate. You can experiment with different K values and evaluate the performance to determine the optimal choice."

The class labels are discrete and represent different categories or classes. In the KNN classifier, the majority vote among the K nearest neighbors is used to determine the class label of the new data point. The class with the highest count among the K neighbors is assigned as the predicted class label. For example, if K=5 and three neighbors belong to class A while two belong to class B, the new data point will be classified as class A.\n",

Instead of using majority voting, the KNN regressor calculates the average (mean or median) of the output values of the K nearest neighbors and assigns it as the predicted value for the new data point. This approach allows the KNN regressor to estimate numerical quantities rather than class labels. For example, if K=5 and the output values of the five nearest neighbors are [2.5, 3.1, 2.9, 2.8, 3.2], the predicted output value for the new data point will be the average of these values, which is approximately 2.9."
